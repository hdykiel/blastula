## Overview

The **blastula** package makes it easy to produce and send HTML email from **R**. The message can have three content areas (the body, the header, and the footer) and we can insert **Markdown** text, **R** expressions, block-based components, and even some raw HTML. The underlying HTML/CSS is meant to display properly across a wide range of email clients and webmail services. The resulting email message is responsive so it'll look great on computers and mobile devices.

## An Example

### Composing an Email Message

When you compose an email, you can use objects from the global workspace and work them into the message content. Let's create a nicely formatted date/time string (`current_date_time`) with the `add_readable_time()` function, and, assign a link to a web image to an object (`img_link`).

```{r local_variables}
# Get a nicely formatted date/time string
current_date_time <- add_readable_time()

# Assign an URL with an image to `img_link`
img_link <- "https://i.imgur.com/p1KvgYj.png"
```

Now we use the `compose_email()` function to compose the email. There are three main arguments here: `body`, `header`, and `footer`. You can supply **Markdown** text to any of these content areas to get rendered HTML.

The insertion of text can be performed by enclosing valid **R** code inside of curly braces (`{...}`). In the example code below, the image URL (as part of the `![...](...)` **Markdown** link construction) is referenced to the `img_link` object from the global workspace. Note also that `{current_date_time}` references the `current_date_time` character object. The end result is the insertion of the date/time string into the footer of the email. (Alternatively, `add_readable_time()` could have been called directly.)

```{r compose_email}
# Generate the body text for the email message
email_text <- 
"
Hello,

This is a great photo of Lake Tahoe. I took \\
it using my new camera.

![]({img_link})
      
You *should go* if you get the chance.
"

email_object <-
  compose_email(
    body = email_text,
    footer = "Email sent on {current_date_time}."
  )
```

After creating the email message, we can look at it to ensure that the formatting is as expected. Simply call the object itself and it will be displayed in the Viewer.

```{r preview_email, eval=FALSE}
# Preview the email
email_object
```

### Sending an Email Message via SMTP

We can store SMTP email credentials in a file using the `create_smtp_creds_file()` function. This will create a hidden credentials file in the working directory. We can also set SMTP access credentials in the system-wide key-value store through the `create_smtp_creds_key()` function.

Having generated a credentials file, we can use the `smtp_send()` function (along with the `creds_file()` credentials helper function) to send the email through an SMTP server.

```{r smtp_send, eval=FALSE}
# Sending email by SMTP using a credentials file
email_object %>%
  smtp_send(
    to = "a_user@web.net",
    from = "personal@email.net",
    subject = "Testing the `smtp_send()` function",
    credentials = creds_file("email_creds")
  )
```

## Installation

The **blastula** package is using a new binary for `smtp` mailing, provided by the **mailsend-go** project. This binary is cross-platform and works on **Windows**, **macOS** (via **Homebrew)**, and **Linux** (**Debian** and **RPM** packages). Information on installation and other important considerations for SMTP sending can be found in [this article](https://rich-iannone.github.io/blastula/articles/sending_using_smtp.html).

You can install the in-development version of **blastula** from **GitHub** using the **remotes** package.

```{r install_github, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
remotes::install_github("rich-iannone/blastula")
```
