\title{Setup function to get SMTP mail working effectively}
\usage{
blast_first()
}
\description{
Run this function first to obtain SMTP mailing functionality for the
\code{\link[=send_email_out]{send_email_out()}} function. That function is deprecated and relies on a
different binary for sending. Therefore, we shouldn't need to use this setup
function.
